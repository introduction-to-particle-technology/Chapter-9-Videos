## Storage and Flow of Powders

This series of videos demonstrate the key features of mass flow and core flow in silos (or hoppers) used for powder storage. 

**Mass flow** - All the powder in a silo is in motion whenever any of it is drawn from the outlet. The flowing channel coincides with the walls of the silo. The powder surface remains level until it reaches the sloping section.

**Core flow** – The powder flows towards the outlet of the silo in a channel formed within the powder itself. The inclined surface of the powder gives rise to size segregation. There are regions of stagnant powder. 

Whether a powder gives mass flow or core flow in a particular silo depends on the friction within the powder (which is complex), the friction between the powder and the silo wall and on the slope of the hopper (the sloping section). So, a silo which gives mass flow with one powder may give core flow with another. 

Also, in section is a demonstration of wall friction in a silo.
